#+TITLE: Elisp Ollama SDK

* Introduction

This project aims to be featureful elisp sdk for [[https://ollama.ai/][Ollama]]. There are existing projects for working with Ollama such as [[https://github.com/zweifisch/ollama][zweifish/ollama]] and [[https://github.com/s-kostyaev/ellama][ellama]]. I want the Elisp Ollama SDK to be a more minimal abstraction over ollama that allows elisp developers to integrate open source (or at least open weight) LLMs into elisp projects using elisp. It will offer much the same level of functionality that the [[https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python][ollama-python]] library offers, but in emacs lisp.
* Project Status
** [2024-02-04 Sun]
The project has only just begun! Though I have used ollama via elisp fairly extensively in the past so I expect to make fairly rapid progress.
